Python introduced dataclasses in version 3.7 to simplify the creation of classes that store data. They reduce boilerplate by automatically generating methods like __init__, __repr__, and __eq__. However, native dataclasses lack built-in validation, meaning you must write custom validation logic to ensure data correctness.

This is where Pydantic comes in. By extending Python's dataclasses, Pydantic adds the ability to validate and parse data directly. 


Pydantic
Bring schema and sanity to your data.
Automatic data validation for type safe and data integrity - Pydantic automatcally validates the incoming data against the field definations (Native Python types, advanced types and custom validators) and performs necessary coercion when possible, otherwise raises `ValidationError`.

Pydantic works by using the `BaseModel` class - the core class. By defining Python classes that inherit from `Basemodel` you can specify the fields your model should contain, including their types, optional fields, default values and validation rules.

Model Configuration: You can customize model behavior using the Config class.
JSON Schema Generation: Pydantic can automatically generate JSON Schema from models, which is useful for API documentation.

Pydantic raises clear and informative error messages when validation fails, showing exactly which field is invalid and why.

Immutable: Once a Pydantic model is instantiated, it is immutable by default, ensuring consistency in your data objects.


BaseModel vs. RootModel: Key Differences
    BaseModel is used for models with nested data structures. It allows you to define multiple fields, each with their own types and validations.
    RootModel is used when the model is one single value, like a list or scalar type, without needing to nest it inside fields.

"""
The Heart of Pydantic: BaseModel
All Pydantic models inherit from BaseModel, and it serves as the foundation for defining your data structure, applying validations, and enabling automatic parsing.
Automatic Data Validation: Pydantic validates data types automatically when you create an instance of the model.
Serialization and Parsing: Pydantic models can easily convert to and from various data formats (e.g., JSON, dict, etc.), making it perfect for APIs or data-driven applications.

"""
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
JSON is a data interchange format. It is a string-based, language-independent (language-agnostic) standard used for representing structured data in a human-readable and machine-readable way. It's primarily used for transmitting data between different systems or applications, such as between a web server and a web browser. 

JSON has strict syntax rules, including:
    Keys must be strings enclosed in double quotes.
    Values can be strings, numbers, booleans (true/false), null, arrays, or other JSON objects.
    Strings must use double quotes.

Python dictionary keys can be any hashable object.

Boolean/Null Representation:
    JSON uses true, false, and null; 
    Python dictionaries use True, False, and None.

json.dumps() converts a Python dictionary to a JSON string.
json.loads() converts a JSON string to a Python dictionary.

When to Use Pydantic Dataclasses vs. BaseModel vs RootModel

    Use Pydantic Dataclasses: When you need a lightweight, dataclass-style structure with validation. Ideal for scenarios where simplicity and type enforcement are key.
    
    Use BaseModel: When you need more advanced features like field aliases, validators, and custom serialization logic.
    
    BaseModel is used for models with nested data structures. It allows you to define multiple fields, each with their own types and validations.
    
    RootModel is used when the model is one single value, like a list or scalar type, without needing to nest it inside fields.

"""
Validation Mechanisms in Pydantic
    1. validate_call is a decorator introduced in Pydantic v2 that allows you to validate function or method inputs using Pydantic models. Itâ€™s an elegant way to ensure that your functions receive correctly formatted data.

    2. Functional validators are external functions designed to validate or transform data before it's processed further. They are especially useful for scenarios where validation logic is complex or needs to be reused across models.

    3. Standard validators are methods defined within a BaseModel using the @field_validator or @model_validator decorators. They are the most common way to enforce custom validation rules for specific fields or the entire model.

Note: without the @validate_call, Python does not force type check or validate even though type hints are specified.

'''
Pydantic's Field function is your go-to tool for adding metadata and constraints to model attributes. It is used to 
1. Set metadata such as default values and descriptions.
2. Apply constraints like length, range, or regex validation.
3. Document and annotate your models for clarity and compatibility.

Common Field Arguments:
1. min_length and max_length: Enforce string length constraints.
2. ge (greater than or equal) and gt (greater than): Validate numerical ranges.
3. regex: Match strings against a regular expression.
